In this project, I designed and built a JavaFX application for managing patients and appointments in a dental clinic. I implemented a user-friendly interface that allows users to add, remove, and update patient and appointment information in a database. I also improved the application's functionality by implementing features such as searching for patients by ID and filtering appointments by date. Additionally, I reduced the complexity of the code by implementing a service layer that handles the logic for interacting with the database. I used Java, JavaFX, SQLite, and the Scanner class for this project. The application has had a significant impact on the efficiency of the dental clinic, as it has streamlined the process of managing patient and appointment information.
